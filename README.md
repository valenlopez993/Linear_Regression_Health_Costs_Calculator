# Health Costs Calculator

This project is part of the Free Code Camp Machine Learning course. Given a large insurance data frame, the goal of the project was to use multiple linear regression to calculate health costs.

In order to make a prediction, the model receives the following information:

- Age
- Sex
- BMI
- Number of children the patient has
- If the patient is a smoker
- The region

and returns the **expenses** within a Mean Absolute Error of $3500.
